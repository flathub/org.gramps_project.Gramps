Thank you for your interest in helping with the Gramps flatpak.  Any changes get submitted to the gramps-project for about a week for the project members to review before getting pushed to flathub, so please submit a pull request at https://github.com/gramps-project/flatpak first so it can be reviewed.

Any help in updating dependencies, especially for the add-ons, is appreciated.  Some of the popular add-ons use old dependencies, so sometimes there is a trade off between having the most up to date dependencies and reduced functionality until the add-ons get updated to use current dependencies.
Also, newer versions of BSDDB3 have licensing issues, and so it won't be updated.

Please keep in mind that some people spend years working on their genealogy databases, and so changes should be tested to make sure they don't cause unintended problems.  Since stability is important, any changes might take some time before being pushed to flathub.
